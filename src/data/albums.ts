          'MTV Unplugged in New York is a live album by the American grunge band Nirvana. It features an acoustic performance taped at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993 for the television series MTV Unplugged. The show was directed by Beth McCarthy and first aired on the cable television network MTV on December 14, 1993. As opposed to traditional practice on the television series, Nirvana played mainly lesser-known material and cover versions of songs by The Vaselines, David Bowie, Meat Puppets (during which they were joined by members of the group onstage) and Leadbelly.\n\nMTV Unplugged in New York was the first Nirvana album released in the wake of the April 1994 death of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the most successful posthumous Nirvana release, selling five million copies in America by 1997. It was hailed by critics as proof the band was able to transcend the grunge sound they were commonly associated with. MTV Unplugged in New York includes two songs which were not aired on the original television broadcast of the concert: "Something in the Way" and "Oh, Me." The album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996. The performance received a DVD release in 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/MTV+Unplugged+in+New+York">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          'Like a Virgin is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on November 12, 1984 by Sire Records. It was re-released worldwide in 1985, with the inclusion of the bonus track "Into the Groove". In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version with two bonus remix tracks. After the release of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to solidify her future in the music business, by building on the success of the first album. She decided to become one of the record producers, but Warner Bros. was not ready to give her the artistic freedom that she wanted. Nile Rodgers was chosen as the primary producer of the album, due to his work with David Bowie.\n\nThe album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic band mates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange of their help. Jason Corsaro, the record\'s audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time. The cover sleeve and images were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make provocative link between her own religious name Madonna, as the Roman Catholic title for Jesus\' mother Mary, and the Christian concept of the virgin birth.\n\nLike a Virgin is not that much of a musical departure from Madonna\'s first album, but she felt that the material was stronger. Along with Rodgers, Madonna also collaborated with her former boyfriend Steve Bray, who co-wrote many songs on the album. Consisting of dance-pop oriented music, the songs also incorporated New Wave. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from the critics, but was a commercial success. It became Madonna\'s first number one album on the Billboard 200, while reaching the top of the charts in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it diamond for shipment of ten million copies across the United States. Worldwide it has sold 21 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, with "Like a Virgin", "Material Girl" and "Into the Groove" becoming worldwide hits. To promote the album, Madonna embarked on The Virgin Tour, which had shows in cities of North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 80s. Madonna proved that she was not a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially "Material Girl" and "Like a Virgin". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, "Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist\'s magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment".\n\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Madonna/Like+a+Virgin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          'Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the British rock band Queen. The record, released on November 2, 1981, is the UK\'s all-time best-selling album. Combined with Greatest Hits II, it became the definitive Queen compilation. While a domestic release with different tracks but the same cover art was available in the U.S. in 1981, the British release was available to United States customers only by import until the 1995 release of Greatest Hits I & II, which combined the two discs. The seventeen-track UK Greatest Hits disc was released in the U.S. on its own for the first time, with a few bonus tracks, in 2004 under the name Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition.\n\nThere was no universal track listing or cover art for the Greatest Hits album, and each territory\'s tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some cases, despite the band\'s popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were "Sweet Lady" and "Love of My Life", neither was released as a single in any country, but appear on some regions\' 1981 Hits release. In the UK and the U.S., where solid numbers could be collected, the standard was raised again by only including top twenty Hits.\n\nThe U.S. ended up with its original edit of Queen\'s first single release, "Keep Yourself Alive", which had been re-released in the U.S. in 1975 (original release was 1973) after the success of "Bohemian Rhapsody". Also, because of the delay in release dates between the UK (out first) and the U.S. (almost a month later), the U.S. was able to add "Under Pressure" (Queen\'s duet with David Bowie) to its Hits collection, as it was released during that interim.\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same list of UK Greatest Hits minus "Seven Seas of Rhye", and including "Love of My Life" (Live Killers version). CD version is the same as the British.\n\nJumping ahead to 1991, Queen sought to issue a second Greatest Hits collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to Hollywood Records, who keen on a massive promotion of the band\'s back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood\'s US licencée). Hollywood Records decided to not release Greatest Hits II to the U.S. market, but instead created their own collection, Classic Queen (1992). This compilation was made up of tracks such as "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Keep Yourself Alive" and "Under Pressure" (which had already appeared on the Elektra 1981 Hits collection) as well as newer tracks ("A Kind of Magic" and "Radio Ga Ga"). Some tracks were not even singles in the U.S. ("One Year of Love") or anywhere ("Stone Cold Crazy"). Though well received, this collection would eventually pose the problem of overlapping track lists in the future.\n\nHollywood Records, later that year, re-released a companion collection Greatest Hits with similar artwork (on a red background, where Classic Queen was on royal blue). Commonly referred to as the Red Greatest Hits, it features most of the \'70s tracks absent from "Classic Queen" (including "Another One Bites the Dust" , "We Will Rock You", "We Are the Champions" and "Killer Queen").\n\nIn 2004, to promote the Las Vegas production of the musical "We Will Rock You", Hollywood Records released Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition which was the UK Greatest Hits with three bonus tracks. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Greatest+Hits">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          'Giant Steps is the fifth studio album by jazz musician John Coltrane as leader. It was released in February 1960 on Atlantic Records. This was his first album as leader for Atlantic Records, with which he had signed a new contract the previous year. The record is regarded as one of the most influential jazz albums of all time. Many of its tracks have become practice templates for jazz saxophonists. In 2004, it was one of fifty recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.

          'All Alone is an album by Frank Sinatra, released in 1962. All of the tracks on the album are torch songs, hence the lonely name of the album. Almost half of the tracks are written by Irving Berlin. The cover is a trimmed portion of painting that hung in Sinatra’s Palm Springs home.\n\nOriginally, All Alone was going to called "Come Waltz With Me." Although the title and the accompanying specially written title song were dropped before the album’s release, the record remained a stately collection of waltzes, arranged and conducted by Gordon Jenkins.\nOut of all the arrangers Sinatra regularly worked with, Jenkins had the most overt classical influences in his writing, making him the perfect choice for the project. Nevertheless, All Alone is an uneven album, even as it is one of the most intriguing records Sinatra recorded.\nDivided between standards and relatively recent tunes, the most distinctive element of the album are the rich, neoclassical arrangements by Jenkins. Sinatra doesn’t strictly follow Jenkins’ intentions. Instead of playing close to the vest, he wrenches the emotions out of the songs. Most of the time, the results are quite moving, especially on the opening and closing Irving Berlin ballads, ‘All Alone’ and ‘The Song Is Ended.’ When the results aren’t quite as successful, they are still interesting, and the elegant, rumanative music makes All Alone a necessary listen for dedicated Sinatra fans.\n\nTrack listing\n\n01 -- “All Alone” (Irving Berlin) – 2:46\n02 -- “The Girl Next Door” (Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane) – 3:21\n03 -- “Are You Lonesome Tonight” (Roy Turk, Lou Handman) – 3:33\n04 -- “Charmaine”, (Erno Rapee, Lew Pollack) – 3:22\n05 -- “What’ll I Do” (Berlin) – 3:18\n06 -- “When I Lost You” (Berlin) – 3:45\n07 -- “Oh, How I Miss You Tonight” (Benny Davis, Joe Burke, Mark Fisher) – 3:25\n08 -- “Indiscreet” (Sammy Cahn, Jimmy Van Heusen) – 3:58\n09 -- “Remember” (Berlin) – 3:28\n10 -- “Together” (B.G. DeSylva, Lew Brown, Ray Henderson, Stephen Ballantine) – 3:23\n11 -- “The Song is Ended” (Berlin) – 3:29\n\nAlbum Notes\n\nReleased: October 1962\nRecorded: January 15–January 17, 1962, Los Angeles\nGenre: Vocal Jazz\nLength: 37:48\nLabel: Reprise\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Sinatra/All+Alone">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          'Kind of Blue is a studio album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. It was recorded on March 2 and April 22, 1959, at Columbia\'s 30th Street Studio in New York City, and released on August 17 of that year by Columbia Records. For the recording, Miles Davis led a sextet featuring saxophonists John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb, with new band pianist Wynton Kelly appearing on one track – "Freddie Freeloader" – in place of Bill Evans.\n\nInfluenced in part by Bill Evans, who had joined the ensemble in 1958, Miles Davis departed further from his early hard bop style in favor of greater experimentation with musical modes, as on his previous album Milestones (1958). Basing Kind of Blue entirely on modality, he gave each performer a set of scales that encompassed the parameters of their improvisation and style, and consequently more creative freedom with melodies; John Coltrane later expanded on this modal approach in his own solo career.\n\nKind of Blue is regarded by many critics as Miles Davis masterpiece, the greatest jazz record, and one of the best albums of all time. Its impact on music, including jazz, rock, and classical genres, has led writers to also deem it one of the most influential albums ever recorded. The album was one of fifty recordings chosen in 2002 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, and in 2003 it was ranked number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2019, Kind of Blue was certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of at least five million copies.\n\nBackground\nBy late 1958, trumpeter Miles Davis employed one of the most acclaimed and profitable hard bop bands. Bassist Paul Chambers had been with the band from its beginning in 1955; alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley joined in late 1957, and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane returned in early 1958. Drummer Jimmy Cobb replaced Philly Joe Jones in May 1958, and pianist Wynton Kelly replaced Bill Evans in November 1958.\n\nThe Miles Davis band played a mixture of pop standards, blues, and bebop originals by composers such as Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, and Tadd Dameron. As with all bebop-based jazz, Miles Davis groups improvised on the chord changes of a given song. Miles Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, however, and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity.\n\nIn 1953, the pianist George Russell published his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, which offered an alternative to improvisation based on chords. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships, his concept introduced the idea of chord/scale unity and was the first theory to explore the vertical relationship between chords and scales, and the only original theory to come from jazz. These insights helped lead the way to modal jazz. Influenced by George Russell\'s ideas, Miles Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of his studio album Milestones (1958). Satisfied with the results, Miles Davis prepared an entire album based on modality. Bill Evans, who had studied with George Russell but had left the Miles Davis group to pursue his career, was drafted back into the project.\n\nRecording\nKind of Blue was recorded on three-track tape in two sessions at Columbia Records\' 30th Street Studio in New York City. On March 2, 1959, the tracks "So What", "Freddie Freeloader", and "Blue in Green" were recorded for side one of the original LP, and on April 22 the tracks "All Blues" and "Flamenco Sketches" were recorded, making up side two.\n\nAs was Miles Davis penchant, he called for almost no rehearsal and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Miles Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Miles Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only "Flamenco Sketches" yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, which is not the master, was added to the 1997 CD reissue of the album as a bonus track. The five master takes issued were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to "Freddie Freeloader" was recorded, but was not used for release or on the issues of Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue.\n\nPianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist\'s feelings, Miles Davis had Wynton Kelly play instead of Bill Evans on the album\'s most blues-oriented number, "Freddie Freeloader". The live album At Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Miles Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.\n\nProduction Credit\nKind of Blue was produced by Columbia staff producer Irving Townsend. However, over the years there has been confusion, with Miles Davis subsequent producer Teo Macero getting partial or full credit. "In the case of Kind of Blue there were two producers: Teo Macero and Irving Townsend", said jazz historian Eric Nisenson. "Teo Macero\'s role, however, was clearly that of an apprentice and observer." The recording session was also cited by Nisenson as Teo Macero\'s first experience with "the highs and lows of working with Miles Davis." From Teo Macero\'s own recollection, his involvement in the recording included "boxing everyone in so that there would be a physical closeness among the musicians, not like today when the musicians are spread all over the place." According to High Fidelity, "though his role in Kind of Blue has been disputed", the recording was "made under the auspices" of Teo Macero. However, it is Irving Townsend\'s voice heard on the session tapes, who became Miles Davis producer after the departures of George Avakian and Cal Lampley. Teo Macero did not produce Miles Davis until after Irving Townsend took over West Coast production duties for Columbia Records, when Teo Macero took his place. Teo Macero\'s first Miles Davis production was his next record, Sketches of Spain.\n\nThe original LP did not credit a producer. The first release with a producer credit was the 1987 CD, which credited only Teo Macero. However, this was in error; Teo Macero only produced that reissue, not the sessions for the original album. The 1997 MiniDisc reissue credited both  Irving Townsend\'s and Teo Macero, but the subsequent 1997, 1999, 2004, 2008, and 2015 reissues all correctly credit only  Irving Townsend\'s.\n\nPersonnel\nCredits are taken from the album\'s liner notes.\n\nMiles Davis – trumpet\nCannonball Adderley – alto saxophone except on "Blue in Green" and bonus disc track "So What"\nJohn Coltrane – tenor saxophone\nBill Evans – piano except on "Freddie Freeloader" and bonus disc track "So What"\nWynton Kelly – piano on "Freddie Freeloader" and bonus disc track "So What"\nPaul Chambers – double bass\nJimmy Cobb – drums <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Kind+of+Blue">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          'Nectar is the second studio album by Joji, following his successful debut record, BALLADS 1, released in October of 2018.\n\nAfter initially announcing a July 2020 release date, Joji postponed the album to September 25, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThe album boasts a variety of featured singers, rappers, and producers, including: Diplo, Omar Apollo, Lil Yachty, rei brown, BENEE, and Yves Tumor.\n\nThe first single from the record, “Sanctuary,” was released on June 14, 2019. The record’s second single, “Run,” released on February 7, 2020. The third single (The more streamed and popular one amongst the four), “Gimme Love,” was released on April 16, 2020, along with the announcement of the title of the album and that it was originally intended to be released on July 10, 2020. The fourth single, a collaboration with Diplo called “Daylight,” was released on August 6, 2020.\n\nThe album takes a sonically different approach from "BALLADS 1", with a sound that’s less focused on Joji’s typical melancholy, lo-fi sound. Instead, the album takes a mix of many retroelements instrumentation from older Joji projects that never got to see the light of streaming services. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joji/Nectar">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          'In Tongues is the debut project by singer-songwriter, Joji, which was released on November 3, 2017. This project is Miller\'s first EP to be released under the Empire label. The project was also re-released as a deluxe version on February 14, 2018.\n\nIn late 2015, the songs "Thom" and "you suck charlie" were leaked onto the internet and prompted Miller, in January 2016, to publicly announce his discontent on a post on Instagram. Miller mentioned that the purpose of the "unknown account" that contained these songs was for the enjoyment of him and his friends. He intended to keep the music a secret from his fanbase as they mainly focused on his comedic music. However, when the account in question was discovered and its music was reuploaded to platforms like YouTube, he felt he had no control over his "own image or identity" and decided to continue his music career under his original stage name. In addition, he linked his Joji SoundCloud account and also announced that he would be releasing a full-length commercial project titled Chloe Burbank: Volume 1 with "Thom" and "you suck charlie" serving as singles. After this, he started to upload more songs onto his SoundCloud.\n\nAfter the release of his album Pink Season under the Pink Guy persona, which debuted atop the iTunes charts and at number 70 on the Billboard 200, he sat down in an interview with Pigeons and Planes and mentioned the reason he has kept using the different pseudonyms saying, "I was doing music way before the Filthy Frank stuff, I\'ve always wanted to make normal music. I just started the YouTube channel to kind of bump my music. But then Filthy Frank and the Pink Guy stuff ended up getting way bigger than I thought so I had to kind of roll with it."\n\nIn December 2016 and January 2017, songs under Joji started to be uploaded onto the 88rising channel, indicating a partnership between Miller and 88rising on future projects. In mid-2017, he released "i dont wanna waste my time" and "rain on me" onto his SoundCloud and on the 88rising channel. In an interview, Miller noted that he had been "making beats and working on a few big projects" and hinted at a full-length Joji project being released.\n\nMiller had previously released his song, "Worldstar Money", on his SoundCloud in April 2016. The lead single from In Tongues titled "Will He" was released on 17 October 2017 accompanied by the music video. The song quickly went to the top of Spotify\'s Global "Viral" chart and remained there until the release of In Tongues on 3 November 2017. Joji had originally announced an upcoming EP on Complex\'s Hot Ones series where celebrities would eat buffalo wings that would increasingly get hotter. The release date was muted in the final version of the video after his manager disapproved with announcing the release date. Following the release of the lead single for In Tongues, "Will He" on 17 October 2017, Joji published the cover to In Tongues on his Twitter account before posting the pre-order link to the album the following day.\n\nA music video for "Demons" was released to the 88rising YouTube channel on 6 December 2017 and for "Window" on 24 January 2018, having teased the latter one back in November 2017. Although not being featured in the track listings for the EP, the songs "Plastic Taste", which was released in 2016, and "I Don\'t Wanna Waste My Time", which was released in 2017, were released exclusively on the deluxe version. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joji/In+Tongues">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is their last recorded album, although Let It Be was the last album released before the band\'s dissolution in 1970. Work on Abbey Road began in April 1969, and the album was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 1 October 1969 in the United States.\n\nAbbey Road is widely regarded as one of The Beatles\' most tightly constructed albums, although the band was barely operating as a functioning unit at the time. Despite the tensions within the band, Abbey Road was released to near universal acclaim and is considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2012, Abbey Road was voted 14th on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2009, readers of the magazine also named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Abbey+Road">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
